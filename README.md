# Experimentally Investigating three Properties of Large-Scale Real World Graphs
The purpose of this project was to experiment with pseudo-random large-scale graphs. These graphs were meant to resemble real-world networks (such as the network of Facebook friends).

The .pdf file describes the purpose of this project in more detail and reports on my findings.

All of the code here is runnable to verify my findings, just run the bash script and it autoamtically compiles and runs the program. You can modify the main.cpp file if you want to experiemnt with a graph of your own (this uses the Barabsi-Albert model to make a pseudo-random graph).
